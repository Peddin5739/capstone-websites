          A product configurator is a software tool or application that allows
          customers to customize and personalize a product according to their preferences
          and requirements. This tool is commonly used by companies that offer customizable
          or made-to-order products, such as computers, cars, furniture, clothing, and more.
          The configurator guides customers through a step-by-step process where they can
          select various features, options, and specifications to create a product that
          aligns with their specific needs and preferences.
